Greetings! I go by the name Prajakta.
My curiosity is piqued by the world of technology and beyond, always eager to delve into new learning experiences.
Presently, my focus lies in mastering GitHub and the art of coding.
I'm actively seeking opportunities to collaborate on projects with a grander vision.
If you'd like to connect, you can reach me via LinkedIn.
